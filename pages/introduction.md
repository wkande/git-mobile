The Git-Mobile app accesses GitHub APIs to render repository and gist information for an
authenticated user. Git-Mobile is built with the
[Ionic](http://www.ionicframework.com)  
Mobile Hybrid Framework, version 2.


#### GitHub APIs
The [GitHub Apis](https://developer.github.com/v3/) version 3 are freely open
endpoints to all of GitHub's data. They are rate limited to 5,000 calls per user per hour. All endpoints provide
detailed JSON data objects that are easy to render using the Angular 2 implementation of Ionic 2. Support by GitHub
is limited but joining the Developer Program can have benefits.
