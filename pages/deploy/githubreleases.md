Git-Mobile releases are made for both iOS and Android simultaneously. The git-mobile
repository is then tagged with a new release. See the
[releases](https://github.com/wkande/git-mobile/releases) page of git-mobile for a list of past releases
and to create a new release.


***
#### Version Numbers
Versions are prefixed with the letter v. Some good tag names might be v1.0.1 or v2.3.4. The version number
contain three numeric digits.

When the tag isnâ€™t meant for production use, a pre-release version label is added after the version. (v0.2.1-alpha or v5.9.0-beta.3).

Git-Mobile follows the
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) practice.

1. MAJOR version, incompatible API changes.
2. MINOR version, add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
3. PATCH version, make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
