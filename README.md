# Git-Mobile
A GitHub mobile client built with the
[Ionic Framework](http://www.ionicframework.com) (version 2).

There are a few mobile apps out there for GitHub but only Git-Mobile runs on both
IOS and Android, at least we think. What's with that?
[Wyoming Software](http://www.wyomingsoftware.com) built and continues to enhance Git-Mobile.

Why build it? To show you we can do it. Fast and well documented. Not to mention
it's great to have GitHub in a little box.

Launch this beauty to look deep inside your GitHub Repositories and Gists. It actually
makes GitHub a little entertaining, one of our requirements. The app's roadmap includes
custom watchers that notify your mobile device about events important to you and so much more.
See the Roadmap inside the app itself for more info.
